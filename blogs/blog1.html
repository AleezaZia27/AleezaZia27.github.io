    <h1>üå± My Journey to Becoming a Data Analyst</h1>

    <p>Hello, I‚Äôm Aleeza Zia, and this is the story of how I turned my curiosity into a journey of becoming a data analyst.</p>

    <p>I grew up in Chakwal, Pakistan, where I completed my BS in Mathematics from the University of Chakwal in 2024. I‚Äôve always been curious ‚Äî the kind of person who doesn‚Äôt just accept answers, but keeps asking why and how. Numbers and patterns fascinated me, but I wanted something more practical: to work with real-world data and uncover the hidden stories inside it.</p>

    <p>In December 2024, I decided to seriously pursue data analytics. At first, it was overwhelming. I still remember opening my first Jupyter notebook and wondering: Am I really cut out for this?</p>

    <p>I started with Excel, then Python. Dr. Chuck‚Äôs ‚ÄúPython for Everybody‚Äù course was a lifesaver ‚Äî his friendly style made learning Python feel less like a punishment and more like a puzzle game. But as I went deeper, the courses became tougher.</p>

    <p>The journey wasn‚Äôt smooth. There were nights when I felt so low that I thought of quitting. Assignments piled up, projects didn‚Äôt run, and quizzes seemed never-ending.</p>

    <p>The IBM Data Science Professional Certificate nearly broke me. It wasn‚Äôt just videos to watch ‚Äî it had coding projects, Jupyter notebooks to build, and challenging quizzes that tested every detail. There were times I stared at an error for hours, feeling frustrated, only to realize the mistake was a missing bracket or wrong indentation.</p>

    <blockquote>But every time I thought of giving up, I reminded myself why I started ‚Äî because I wanted to turn curiosity into skill. Slowly, step by step, things started to click.</blockquote>

    <p>Looking back, those nine months of learning were some of the hardest yet most rewarding months of my life.</p>

    <h2>What I Learned</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>I learned to push through self-doubt.</li>
        <li>I learned that failure in a quiz isn‚Äôt the end ‚Äî it‚Äôs just feedback.</li>
        <li>I learned the discipline of building something real, not just consuming content.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And when I finally finished my certifications, I realized it wasn‚Äôt just about a certificate to put on my portfolio ‚Äî it was about the resilience I built along the way.</p>

    <p>For me, becoming a data analyst wasn‚Äôt just about mastering Excel, Python, or SQL. It was about learning persistence. It was about proving to myself that even when things get tough, I can adapt, learn, and keep moving forward.</p>

    <p>That‚Äôs why data analytics excites me so much ‚Äî because it‚Äôs not just about numbers on a screen, it‚Äôs about solving puzzles, telling stories, and constantly growing.</p>

    <p>So yes, my journey started with doubt and struggle, but it‚Äôs shaping into something bigger: a career built on curiosity, perseverance, and a love for data.</p>
