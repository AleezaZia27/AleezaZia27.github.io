    <h1>My Projects – A Journey of Hard Work</h1>

    <p>Behind every project in my portfolio, there’s a story of effort, late nights, struggles, and small victories that kept me moving forward.</p>

    <h2>Major Projects</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Chakwal Climate Analysis:</strong> Explored 24 years of climate and solar trends. Not just numbers, but meaningful insights about my hometown.</li>
        <li><strong>Solving Mysteries with Code:</strong> A sentiment analysis project analyzing reviews of seven mystery games. Learned how coding and emotions intersect.</li>
        <li><strong>PSL Commentary & Historical Analysis:</strong> Handled ball-by-ball cricket data from 2016 to 2025 in R. Built an interactive Shiny dashboard after hours of cleaning and structuring data.</li>
        <li><strong>Global Superstore Project:</strong> Used SQL and Python to explore sales, regions, and profit patterns. Learned discipline and advanced problem-solving skills.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Across all these projects, I pushed myself to build dashboards in Tableau, Streamlit, Shiny, and Dash by Plotly. Sometimes the code didn’t run. Sometimes the visualization wouldn’t render. And honestly, there were days I felt too stressed to continue.</p>

    <blockquote>But persistence always won over frustration. Step by step, I fixed bugs, learned new libraries, and refined my work until everything finally clicked.</blockquote>

    <p>Looking back, these projects aren’t just about technical skills. They are proof of my hard work, my ability to adapt, and my determination to finish what I start. Each project carries a piece of my journey — and together, they tell the story of a data analyst who doesn’t quit, even when things get tough.</p>
