    <h1>ðŸ’» My Projects â€“ A Journey of Hard Work</h1>

    <p>Behind every project in my portfolio, thereâ€™s a story of effort, late nights, struggles, and small victories that kept me moving forward.</p>

    <p>My very first big project was <strong>Chakwal Climate Analysis</strong>, where I explored 24 years of climate and solar trends. It was not just about numbers but about making sense of data that directly connects to my hometown. I wanted to see how climate change is shaping the place I belong to, and translating it into insights was deeply personal.</p>

    <p>Then came <strong>Solving Mysteries with Code</strong> â€” a sentiment analysis project where I analyzed reviews of seven mystery games I had played. This was fun and challenging at the same time, because coding and emotions donâ€™t usually mix. But using Python libraries for sentiment analysis, I discovered how words hold hidden patterns.</p>

    <p>One of my toughest challenges was <strong>PSL Commentary & Historical Analysis</strong>. Imagine handling ball-by-ball cricket data from 2016 to 2025 in R! It required so much cleaning, structuring, and transforming. There were moments when I got stuck for hours, wondering if the dashboard would ever come to life. But when I finally built an interactive Shiny dashboard, it felt like victory after a long match.</p>

    <p>Another milestone was the <strong>Global Superstore Project</strong>, where I used SQL and Python to explore sales, regions, and profit patterns. Turning raw CSVs into meaningful business insights wasnâ€™t easy, but it taught me discipline and problem-solving at a deeper level.</p>

    <p>Across all these projects, I pushed myself to build dashboards in Tableau, Streamlit, Shiny, and Dash by Plotly. Sometimes the code didnâ€™t run. Sometimes the visualization wouldnâ€™t render. And honestly, there were days I felt too stressed to continue. But persistence always won over frustration. Step by step, I fixed bugs, learned new libraries, and refined my work until everything finally clicked.</p>

    <p>Looking back, these projects arenâ€™t just about technical skills. They are proof of my hard work, my ability to adapt, and my determination to finish what I start. Each project carries a piece of my journey â€” and together, they tell the story of a data analyst who doesnâ€™t quit, even when things get tough.</p>
