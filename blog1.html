    <h1>🌱 My Journey to Becoming a Data Analyst</h1>

    <p>Hello, I’m Aleeza Zia, and this is the story of how I turned my curiosity into a journey of becoming a data analyst.</p>

    <p>I grew up in Chakwal, Pakistan, where I completed my BS in Mathematics from the University of Chakwal in 2024. I’ve always been curious — the kind of person who doesn’t just accept answers, but keeps asking why and how. Numbers and patterns fascinated me, but I wanted something more practical: to work with real-world data and uncover the hidden stories inside it.</p>

    <p>In December 2024, I decided to seriously pursue data analytics. At first, it was overwhelming. I still remember opening my first Jupyter notebook and wondering: Am I really cut out for this?</p>

    <p>I started with Excel, then Python. Dr. Chuck’s “Python for Everybody” course was a lifesaver — his friendly style made learning Python feel less like a punishment and more like a puzzle game. But as I went deeper, the courses became tougher.</p>

    <p>The journey wasn’t smooth. There were nights when I felt so low that I thought of quitting. Assignments piled up, projects didn’t run, and quizzes seemed never-ending.</p>

    <p>The IBM Data Science Professional Certificate nearly broke me. It wasn’t just videos to watch — it had coding projects, Jupyter notebooks to build, and challenging quizzes that tested every detail. There were times I stared at an error for hours, feeling frustrated, only to realize the mistake was a missing bracket or wrong indentation.</p>

    <p>But every time I thought of giving up, I reminded myself why I started — because I wanted to turn curiosity into skill. Slowly, step by step, things started to click.</p>

    <p>Looking back, those nine months of learning were some of the hardest yet most rewarding months of my life.</p>

    <p>I learned to push through self-doubt.</p>
    <p>I learned that failure in a quiz isn’t the end — it’s just feedback.</p>
    <p>I learned the discipline of building something real, not just consuming content.</p>

    <p>And when I finally finished my certifications, I realized it wasn’t just about a certificate to put on my portfolio — it was about the resilience I built along the way.</p>

    <p>For me, becoming a data analyst wasn’t just about mastering Excel, Python, or SQL. It was about learning persistence. It was about proving to myself that even when things get tough, I can adapt, learn, and keep moving forward.</p>

    <p>That’s why data analytics excites me so much — because it’s not just about numbers on a screen, it’s about solving puzzles, telling stories, and constantly growing.</p>

    <p>So yes, my journey started with doubt and struggle, but it’s shaping into something bigger: a career built on curiosity, perseverance, and a love for data.</p>
