# Aleeza Zia ‚Äì Data & E-commerce Analyst Portfolio

## About
Hi, I'm **Aleeza Zia** üëã ‚Äî a **Data & E-commerce Analyst** with a strong foundation in **Applied Mathematics (BS Mathematics)** and multiple **Google and IBM Professional Certifications** in Data Science, Data Analytics, and Advanced Data Analytics.  

My journey started as a mathematics tutor, where I spent five years sharpening my problem-solving and analytical skills by guiding students through complex concepts. Over time, I realized that my true passion lay in **data ‚Äî uncovering hidden patterns, predicting outcomes, and creating meaningful visual stories that drive smarter decisions**.  

Today, I specialize in transforming raw datasets into actionable insights using **Python, R, SQL, Tableau, and Power BI**, and I design **interactive dashboards** that bring numbers to life. From analyzing **climate change and solar energy potential in Chakwal**, to building **sports analytics dashboards for the Pakistan Super League**, to applying **NLP for gaming sentiment analysis**, I thrive on projects that merge technical rigor with real-world impact.  

What excites me most is the **intersection of data, business, and storytelling**. I enjoy exploring how numbers translate into strategies, how dashboards simplify complexity, and how predictive models can shape smarter futures. I am constantly pushing myself to learn new tools, embrace challenging datasets, and turn curiosity into insights.  

When I‚Äôm not coding or visualizing, you‚Äôll likely find me **gardening**, experimenting with new analysis techniques, or writing blogs that reflect on my learning journey. Whether collaborating in teams or working independently, I bring energy, creativity, and precision to every project I take on.
